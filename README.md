# Youth Bible Engagement App 🙏🏿

![App](data/image/App-Image.png)

A lightweight interactive web app designed to increase Bible engagement among youth (ages 18–30) through trivia, daily encouragement, and simple reflection tools.

The app combines Bible-based interaction, AI-assisted encouragement, and engagement analytics to support youth ministries in making Scripture interaction more consistent and engaging.

Built with Python, Streamlit, and simple data analytics tools.

## Why This App Exists

Youth ministries often struggle with one common challenge:

This is a challenge I have faced myself being a youth leader

- Maintaining consistent engagement with Scripture outside church services.

Many young adults are:

- busy with school or work

- overwhelmed by information online

- unsure where to start reading the Bible

- more responsive to interactive digital tools

This app was designed to provide simple, low-friction entry points to Scripture interaction.
Instead of expecting long reading sessions, it focuses on:

- quick Bible trivia

- topic-based encouragement

- short reflection prompts

- simple prayer generation

These small interactions make Scripture engagement easier to start and repeat.
The goal is not to replace traditional Bible study, but to encourage frequent touchpoints with Scripture.

## Key Features ⚙️
**Bible Trivia**

An interactive trivia system where users can test their Bible knowledge.

### Features:

- Difficulty levels (Easy, Medium, Hard)
- Randomized questions
- Score tracking during each session
- Verse references shown after each answer

This helps reinforce Bible knowledge in a fun and low-pressure format.

## Verse & Prayer Generator

Users can select a life topic such as:

- Stress
- Healing
- Joy
- Anxiety
- Fear

The app will:

Select a relevant Bible verse
- Display the verse text
- Generate a short explanation
- Generate a short prayer
- Provide a reflection question

If the AI service is unavailable, the app uses a built-in fallback encouragement system so the experience continues smoothly.

## Leader Dashboard

A simple analytics dashboard designed for youth leaders.

The dashboard tracks engagement such as:

- number of trivia attempts
- accuracy across difficulty levels
- most requested encouragement topics
- most frequently shown verses
- fallback usage when AI is unavailable

This allows leaders to see how youth are interacting with the app.
